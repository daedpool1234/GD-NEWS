<p>Following its launch, Ben 10 inspired a number of sequel series and a full-blown reboot in 2016. The new series wrapped in late 2020 before several specials rolled out through April 2021. Of course, Ben 10 also inspired a number of video games and TV films as well as books. For kids born in the late '90s and early '00s, Ben 10 was a must-watch, so the franchise has some serious nostalgia backing it. If a new project were to be ordered of the series, Ben 10 fans would be nothing but excited.</p>
